Here is what i want to build - A CRM for an organization similar to Bigin Zoho crm but with limited functionality - 
- Give a api end point to Collect leads data and storing in supabase (like some submit a form using another website.)
- Link google workspace email account with the help of Domain-wide Delegation
- send email to that lead using linked email with the help of gmail api

1. Tech Stack 
  Next.js, Supabase, Google Api for sending email and managing email.

2. Supabase Auth for authentication
   - it don't have any signup functionality
   - it have only login functionality
   - after login there is a otp verification with the help of a otp_request table
   - for otp verification, otp is send using resend to the admin of the project with the OTP.
   - admin add a new user to the users in the authentication of supabase from the CRM with assigning a role to the user.
